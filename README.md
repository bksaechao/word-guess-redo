## Javascript Homework

<p>This assignment challenged knowlege and application of javascript. The task was to create a word guess game using only javascript, html, & css.<p>

<p>Assignement was still quite challenging on my second attempt, but code is a lot cleaner. Design is nicer as well. Overall a tough, fun challenge!
